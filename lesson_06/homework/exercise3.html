    SMILEY: Hi, Lia. What seems to be the problem today?
    <br><br>
    LIA: I hope you can tell me! A chunk of my tooth broke off yesterday.<br>
    SMILEY: That’s not good. Did you bite something hard?
    <br><br>
    LIA: No, I didn’t . . . that’s the weird thing. It just kind of fell out.
    <br><br>
    SMILEY: Did it hurt when it broke?<br>
    LIA: Yes, it did, just a little; but it started to hurt like crazy this morning.
    <br><br>
    SMILEY: I think we’d better take a full set of X-rays . . . Okay, open wide. Let me take a look. Oh, boy. Yes, it looks like you’ve exposed the root on your left, molar.
    <br><br>
    LIA: rgscht rfghsh!! ghs gtfhhkj?<br>
    SMILEY: Sorry. I’ll be done in a minute. I’m afraid you’ll have to have a root canal. I can put in a temporary filling, but you’ll have to come back in two weeks for the procedure.
    <br><br>
    LIA: Do I have to have a root canal? My tooth doesn’t really hurt too much.
    <br><br>
    SMILEY: If we don’t take care of this quickly, it may become infected, and it will hurt a lot. I’ll tell Dina to set up an appointment, and I’ll see you back here in two weeks, on Tuesday, the 14th, at 3 p.m.<br>
    LIA: Will the procedure hurt?
    <br><br>
    SMILEY: I’ll give you medication so that you won’t feel any pain. Relax! It’s not so bad!
